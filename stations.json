     "longDesc": "RadioSpiral was founded by Mike Metlay and Diana Smethurst as a means to continue what they both love doing - promoting electronica by performing it and hosting shows with some of the best of the genre. We're commited to the promotion of electronic/ambient music, and endeavour to not only air great electronica on the station but use other media, such as Second Life, to share it with new listeners."
