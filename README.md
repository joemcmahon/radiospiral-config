# radiospiral-config
Configuration repository for the RadioSpiral streaming radio app

This repository contains the web-based config files for the RadioSpiral
streaming radio application, for RadioSpiral, based at https://radiospiral.net.

The config files here are
 - stations.json: a file defining the station's main streaming URL, name and short
   description. Should RadioSpiral host other streams at a later date, this file
   could be updated to push out the new streams in real time.
